# Quick Fix for Terminal Errors on macOS

## Your Problem
Terminal shows errors when opening because the `.zsh-aliases` file format is incompatible with Zsh parsing.

## Instant Solution (2 commands)

```zsh
cd /Users/loganathan.sekaran/git/QuickSaveAlias
./repair_mac.sh
```

Then restart your terminal or run:
```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

## What This Does

The repair script automatically:
1. ✓ Backs up your existing files (`.backup` extension)
2. ✓ Installs the latest macOS/Zsh version
3. ✓ Fixes your `.zshrc` configuration  
4. ✓ Repairs the `.zsh-aliases` file format
5. ✓ Configures special character aliases properly

## That's It!

Your terminal will open without errors and all your aliases will work correctly.

## If You Want to Understand More

- Read [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for details about Linux to macOS migration
- Read [README.md](README.md) for full documentation
- The Troubleshooting section in README has solutions for specific issues

## Important Note

- **Linux version is unchanged** - The Bash version (`quicksavealias.sh`) remains fully functional
- **macOS uses a separate version** - The Zsh version (`quicksavealias_mac.sh`) is optimized for macOS
- Both versions work independently and don't affect each other

## Your Backups Are Safe

All your aliases are backed up at:
- `~/.zsh-aliases.backup`
- `~/.quicksavealias.sh.backup`
- `~/.zsh_special_aliases.sh.backup`
